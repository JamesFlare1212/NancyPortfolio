One of my prototypes is painted with gouache and the other with oil painting sticks. Fany enjoyed the texture created by the oil sticks and the fine details drawn with colored pencils. Overall, the gouache prototype looks more cohesive because its style aligns closely with art deco aesthetics. This feedback helps me understand which elements reflect art deco style well, giving me insight for further research and revisions.

My next steps will be to carefully analyze how positive and negative shapes work in my poster, make thoughtful color choices, and add more tactile textures.

Our group has scheduled two offline meetings, from 5pm to midnight on Sunday, October 29, and 7pm to midnight on Wednesday, November 1. Having two in-person work sessions will enable us to effectively collaborate and problem-solve. We will continue exploring art deco style, considering how positive/negative shapes impact the design, and experimenting with different color palettes and fonts.

To maintain visual consistency across posters, we will fully integrate the 4 designs, with each person spearheading a different step. Rouyu will compose the overall layout and detailed drawings, I will handle the painting, and Fany and Ali will create paper collages. We will finalize the composition and drawings by Saturday, painting by Monday, and devote the remaining time to paper collages and typography.
