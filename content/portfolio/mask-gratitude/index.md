Having a mask made for me was an amazing experience. It had been a long time since I last wore a mask that covered most of my face. With the mask on, I could conceal my facial expressions and hide the direction of my gaze. The mask allowed me to transform into something more special rather than my usual self.Â 

The mask was crafted based on my personality. As an INFP personality type known for being introverted and sensitive, my partner appropriately chose a deer as the mask's main motif. Chinese cultural elements like Peking Opera masks and hemp rope were incorporated as nods to my cultural background that greatly influenced me. Spikes were added to the forehead for helping me protect myself.

What captivated me most were the mask's exaggerated branches. Nylon lace was intertwined with the branches in a fusion of nature and human artifice. To reflect my tendency towards introversion paired with kindness, my partner embellished the mask with ribbons of silk.
