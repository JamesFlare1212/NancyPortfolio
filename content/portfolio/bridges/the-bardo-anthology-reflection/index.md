In this project, we are divided into groups to accomplish two specific tasks, one is the novel writing for seminar, the other is the poster making for studio. The novel is built based on different themes and archetypes. The theme for our group is monster/hero.

## Writing Process

This project pushed me way outside my comfort zone since I had never attempted creative fiction writing before. I found the entire process of imagining characters and settings then translating those ideas into text incredibly challenging but also stimulating. Our brainstorming and feedback sessions inspired me to explore directions I never would have thought of on my own. Using online collaborative documents took some adjustment but allowed us to watch the story unfold in real-time together. Even though the end result was rough around the edges given our time constraints, the experience taught me so much about generating and refining creative work. I also picked up new technical skills in utilizing digital platforms to facilitate remote collaboration.

## Making Process

Working together with my classmates to write a cohesive narrative was an interesting challenge. Since we all had unique writing styles and different ideas about plot and characters, it sometimes felt like we were pulling the story in multiple directions. I learned how to listen to everyone’s input and find compromises so we could blend our perspectives into one narrative. There were times when we disagreed over story directions or when miscommunications occurred, but through open discussions we found ways to align our visions. Although the process was difficult at times, it was rewarding to see our separate voices and concepts transformed into a unified story in the end. Especially when we tried to make the novel more stylized, when we added the header and footer embellishments and the first character oversize, we really felt like it wasn’t just some text anymore, it really did have a novel feel in it, which gave us a sense of accomplishment.

## Researching Process

The research process was an integral part of brainstorming our storyline and settings before beginning the writing process. We realized that high-quality research lays the foundation for the creative work that follows. Our initial ideas come from researching sources of inspiration and references to build a compelling concept. Once we established a solid base through research, the creative writing process could develop organically from there. We tried to explore many ideas by referencing novels, films, and other narratives we found inspiring in their storytelling techniques. Sources like Moana, Divergent, and Godzilla sparked our imagination. Researching visual references was also key, since we wanted to connect our characters to specific locations. By gathering images of settings we envisioned, we could align our understanding of the story’s physical context. Overall, this project showed me how dedicated research time informs the creative process from start to finish.
