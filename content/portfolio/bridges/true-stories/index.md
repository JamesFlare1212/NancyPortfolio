## Hide and Seek

When I decided to play hide and seek, I suddenly had a wonderful idea and thanks to some handy fabric. And the result? Well, let's just say it's a total quirk that's left everyone scratching their heads.

Imagine this: I'm looking for a place to hide myself, and suddenly I feel like as long as I can't see anyone else, no one can see me. So I carefully wrapped my head in the fabric and let it pour down in a magical way, forming the strangest shapes.

Since then, the nature of the hide-and-seek has changed. It was no longer a game, but an evaluation and discussion of my performance art. Some compared it to a black, twisted ice cream cone with swirls and contours that rival any frozen food. Others sweared it is a mysterious tree whose black head shoots straight up into the sky.

My masterpiece, whatever it is, was proof of the absurdity of art. It encourages viewers to delve into abstraction, question what exactly they're looking at, and appreciate the joy that unfolds when artists hide behind their own art. Even if I was just playing hide-and-seek at first.

## Going Up!

With each laborious step up the staircase in the New York City subway, the environment around me underwent a dramatic transformation. What had begun as a narrow, dimly lit underpass gradually gave way to a bright, expansive vista. Emerging from the subterranean shadows, my eyes struggled to adjust to the sudden onslaught of sunlight. My brow furrowed, and my palms began to glisten with a hint of nervous sweat. I pursed my lips, attempting to acclimate to my new surroundings, as the faint scent of rubbish still lingered in the air, now masked by the overpowering perfume of hurried urbanites passing by.

Amidst this sensory overload, my thoughts swirled with uncertainties. Could I summon the courage to lift my head, to face the sun, to embrace New York City's vibrant chaos?

Suddenly, the flickering subway light above me ceased its dance and cast a steady, guiding beam forward. My gaze fixed on that beacon, and with newfound resolve, I decided to ascend. I was determined to rise above my doubts and uncertainties. "I believe I'm going up well," I whispered to myself, a mantra of aspiration that echoed in my mind as I ventured forth into the unknown, ready to conquer the challenges and opportunities that awaited in the city that never sleeps.

## The Poster

On the bustling streets of New York, I find myself standing in a sea of people, each rushing past me, lost in their own world. The energy of the city surges around me, reminding me constantly of its relentless pace. Across the street, a towering skyscraper hung a dazzling poster of a model, her lithe body elegantly writhing in seductive poses, dressed in elaborate outfits designed to capture the essence of glamour.

Instead of feeling the typical inadequacy and anxiety, I am overcome by a profound transformation. In that moment, I am no longer just a spectator; I become the architect of my own future. I have the power to shape my own destiny. I feel my fists clenched, my faith strengthened, my determination maintained

Staring at that charming poster, I no longer feel inferior. Instead, I see an opportunity, a gateway to my own potential. That poster would have been a sign, a sign that I had the power to shape not only my future, but the world around me. Just as an artist shapes the image of that model, I can shape my own life, my own ambitions and my own destiny.

## Reflection

During my writing on the project, I had a new perspective on words. Previously, I had relegated words to the status of mere conveyors of information, often viewing them as simplistic instruments for statement, description, or as supplements to visual imagery. However, as I embarked on the creative journey of weaving literature alongside my visual compositions, a striking revelation began to crystalize: words possessed an inherent power that could, at times, rise to dominance. It can have interesting reversals, it can be an affirmation of the will, or it can be a call for the future. This newfound insight forced me to reexamine my previously held assumptions about the nature of writing, leaving me with a profound appreciation for the multifaceted and potent nature of words.

For this project, I did not use materials that I had not used before, so there is not much that can be reflect in this section. However, when I used keynote for typesetting, my ideas began to change according to my typesetting, such as the length of the article and the composition of the picture.

For the researching part,  When I read this book, “Sophie Calle - True Stories” I was surprised by the magic that unfolded within its pages. It taught me that even a simple picture combined with concise words could carry the enchantment of a full-fledged novel. The book approached storytelling from a unique angle, using abstract yet intriguing images and wrapping things up with sentences that left you thinking deeply. What struck me most was how quickly it drew me into the protagonist's world. I found myself feeling what they felt and contemplating the same thoughts they did.  It was like a direct connection to their experiences and emotions. This book showed me that simplicity, when done right, can have a profound impact on readers. It proved that brevity, combined with thoughtful imagery and endings, can deliver an immersive and thought-provoking experience akin to that of a much longer novel.
