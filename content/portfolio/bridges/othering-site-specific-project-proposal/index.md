## Introduction & Research

In this project, I would study the theme of "Injustice". I want to explore how groups of people with disabilities have historically been marginalized and "otherized," suffering from various experiences of segregation, discrimination and oppression. Examples of oppression of the disabled from the Middle Ages to modern times are listed, reflecting the mainstream society's disregard and prejudice towards the disabled for a long time. This "otherization" exacerbates the vulnerable position of the disabled. I would like to call on people to pay attention to the rights and interests of the disabled, implement barrier-free environment, and improve relevant laws and regulations.

In medieval Europe, people with disabilities were often seen as being in league with the devil and needed to be separated. Some areas even practice the barbaric practice of drowning disabled babies. This reflects the fear and prejudice against disability that prevailed in the Middle Ages. In the 19th century in Britain and the United States, disabled people were inhumanely sent to madhouses and chums, where they were interned with the mentally ill. This severely deprives them of their personal freedom and treats them as "others" who need to be excluded from society. Under Nazi Germany's euthanasia program, 300,000 disabled people were systematically slaughtered. The disabled were regarded by the Nazi authorities as a group whose "life is not worth living" and were subjected to horrific genocide. To this day, in many countries, persons with disabilities are segregated in education, public Spaces lack accessibility, and there is a variety of explicit and implicit discrimination in employment. This reflects that mainstream society's disregard for the rights and interests of the disabled still exists.

## Empathize

The main audience for this project is the general public, especially those who still have misunderstandings and prejudices towards people with disabilities. Through this project, I hope to help the audience gain a deeper understanding of the needs and feelings of people with disabilities, and cultivate empathy and inclusiveness.

For most members of society, disability issues may still be unfamiliar territory. Many may have never put themselves in the shoes of disabled people to consider the difficulties a disability brings to one's life. They may not be aware of the importance of an accessible and friendly social environment for the disabled. Therefore, I hope that through this project, more people will face the issues of disability, and understand that disability should not obstruct one's pursuit of self-worth.

By conveying the stories and feelings of individuals with disabilities, I hope to help the audience deepen their empathy for the disabled, reflect on their own potential biases, and take action to support the disabled community and create better environments for their growth and development. If everyone could do a little something for the disabled, we could together build a more caring and equitable society.

## Define

The stereotype that this project wants to explore and critique is the misconception that people with disabilities cannot live and work independently. Many believe that the disabled rely on assistance from others in order to live, and cannot have normal jobs.

I think it is important to criticize and correct this stereotype because it severely damages the dignity and development opportunities of people with disabilities. This misunderstanding leads to low expectations from society towards the disabled, hindering them from accessing equal education and employment. Many disabled individuals are fully capable of living and working independently with assistive devices, accessible environments, and self-effort. Mainstream society needs to realize that disability should not be presumed as a reason for dependence â€“ every disabled person should have the right to choose their own lifestyle and career. If society can break this bias and provide fair treatment and support for the disabled, they would also have more opportunities to achieve self-worth and contribute to society.

Through this project, I hope more people will recognize the independence of the disabled, reflect on their own prejudices, and take action to help the disabled enjoy equal rights and live with dignity and autonomy. This is crucial not only for the disabled themselves, but also for building a just and inclusive society.

I plan to create an installation art work, the purpose of which is to arouse the public's care for people with disabilities. The work will use objects such as wheelchairs, crutches, and glasses to represent disability, and will be accompanied by broken mirrors to illustrate misunderstandings in mainstream society. The inclusion of obstacles in the space symbolizes the accessibility problems faced by persons with disabilities. At the same time, contrasting lighting and audio of disabled people telling stories will create a moving atmosphere. Viewers can deepen their empathy for disability by experiencing interactive games in which people with disabilities complete simple tasks. It is hoped that this installation will raise awareness of the need for support and respect for people with disabilities, and then take action to promote their rights.
