## Letter of advice for Mina

Dear Mina,

Thank you for opening up in our recent interview about the difficulties you've faced fitting into both Taiwan and the United States after going to high school abroad. I appreciate you sharing so candidly about feeling caught between two cultures no matter where you go.

This is a challenging situation, but remember - your unique background is a gift! You have been exposed to different perspectives and ways of life that most people will never experience. The key is learning how to embrace both sides of yourself, rather than feeling you have to choose one over the other.

Try not to put pressure on yourself to conform to any one culture or friend group. As you realized in high school, the best approach is often to proudly share things from your own background to enrich your current environment, instead of solely trying to fit in. Appreciate and celebrate the diversity within yourself.

Realize too that everyone struggles with issues of identity and belonging, especially during the teenage years. Many of your peers, even if they appear to "fit in", are just putting on masks to hide their own insecurities. You have the chance to inspire others to embrace their uniqueness. Lead with compassion - both for others and yourself.

When you feel isolated or like you don't belong, try to shift your perspective. Instead of focusing on fitting in, focus on the chance to learn. Observe how others interact and communicate. Be curious. You have the incredible opportunity to build bridges across cultures and see the world in a way few people can. Every moment is a chance to gain insight into a new perspective. Lean into this mindset, and loneliness will fade into interest and empathy.

Remember that identity and belonging are complex, ever-changing things. You do not have to force yourself into a box or permanently choose one culture over another. Humans are wonderfully adaptable creatures, so have faith in your ability to gradually find your place, in Taiwan or America or anywhere else life takes you. It won't happen overnight, but little by little you will create a community and find activities and interests that excite you.

Most importantly, know that you are enough just as you are. You do not need to prove your worth to anyone. Stay grounded in your values, embrace the adventure of life, and let your unique identity bloom. The right people and opportunities will be drawn to your authenticity. Follow your deepest interests - whether that be art, music, writing, or anything else that stirs your spirit. Seek out new experiences that spark your curiosity. Stay open and eager to learn. Lead with empathy, compassion, and sincerity in all your interactions. If you do these things, connections and opportunities will naturally blossom around you.

Your rich blend of Taiwanese and American cultures is something to be proud of. You have an insider's view into both Eastern and Western worlds - their traditions, values, and perspectives. This is a precious gift if you embrace it fully. When you feel torn between two sides of yourself, remember that everything you've experienced makes you who you are. Your mixed background shaped your unique interests, insights, and talents. Let it be your guide as you navigate new environments, not something that confuses your sense of identity. Share the best of both cultures, appreciate the woven threads of your history that make you a vibrant tapestry.

You are at the start of a great adventure. Trust the journey! Have compassion for yourself and others, embrace the colorful mosaic within you, and life will reveal its wonders. I believe in you!

With love and encouragement,  
Nancy

## Reflection

During my writing on the project, I found that this is the first time I have written such a formal letter full of advice to someone, and I have never written a letter and given such official advice before. Therefore, when I picked up the pen, I pondered for a long time and was a little nervous about what would happen if what I wrote offended my partner and what would happen if my suggestions were useless. Finally, I tried to listen to the audio of our interview repeatedly, and then started from what I felt most. I tried to empathize with my partner's difficulties, and what would I do if I were in her situation. And my mind just exploded from there.

Based on my suggestions to my partner, I began to use design thinking at my studio class. First, I defined the difficulties of my partner and the methods I gave, and then ideate them. The letter I wrote to my partner became a very strong basement for the define and ideation process in the design thinking for my studio class.

For the making part of this project, I'm pretty good at origami, but I had a different feeling when I folded the envelope and put the letter in. When I first printed the letter, it was just a normal writing assignment, no different from the previous ones. But when I folded it and put it in the envelope, its state changed completely. It is no longer a simple assignment, but a real letter. It is my sincere advice to my partner.

The interview part, also the research part of the whole project, is the place where we really get to know each other. Iâ€˜ve been a little scared before a formal interview. I'm not a particularly social, talkative person, but as the interview progressed I tried to focus more on the problem itself rather than my own state. Concentration is a very magical thing, you will enter a state of "only the person in front of you is with you", so that you can better resonate with her, to understand her, to stand in her point of view to think, solve problems.
