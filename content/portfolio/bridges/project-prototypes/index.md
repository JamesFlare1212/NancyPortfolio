## Introduction

Here we aim to develop creative ideas for the final through experimental, playful prototyping. The goal is to take initial concepts and make them tangible in a low-stakes, exploratory way. The prototyping phase will provide crucial experience developing my concepts through risk-taking and play. I’ll observe what works, what doesn’t, and determine the logical next steps to move the project forward. This is an opportunity to make ideas tangible and evaluate as the project takes shape.

## Prototype 1

This is my first prototype. I focused on top to down installation and experimented with different material combinations including transparent objects, twisters, sequins, opaque ornaments and small shiny stones. My goal was to explore how light and shadow interacted with these materials to produce different visual effects. For instance, each material reflected light differently.

### Reflection

Upon reflection, I realize there is a mismatch between my original intent to explore light and shadow, and the actual installation I created. Going forward, I want to set aside those experiments for now, and focus more on developing the installation itself.

I will keep the twister as the overarching framework, but remove some materials like the transparent fabrics, since I’m pivoting away from light and shadow effects.

## Prototype 2

For my second prototype, I utilized a bottom to up installation. The foundation is a 10×10 grid built out of twisted sticks. On top, I constructed realistic structures using various materials. Soft wool was used to pave roads, while shiny, reflective papers created metaphorical obstacles. The exterior was covered in disorganized wool tufts.

Through this installation, I aimed to communicate two ideas. First, the soft, woolen roads represent the proper path that should be followed. In contrast, the highly visible reflective obstacles signify pitfalls that can be noticed and avoided if one has sight. Second, the chaotic external wool tufts symbolize negative events. A seeing person could easily navigate around obstacles and reach the endpoint. However, as a blind individual, the journey would be much more difficult filled with unknown barriers.

## Final Reflection

Making the second prototype was challenging because I had to pivot and change directions from my original exploration of light and shadow effects. Shifting focus required me to rethink the installation’s purpose and meaning from scratch while still building upon some aspects like the twisted stick framework. I struggled with letting go of certain ideas I was attached to while being open to a new creative direction.

I don’t feel fully ready to begin the final artwork yet. While I have a basic conceptual framework with the second prototype, I need to further refine the symbolic meanings and what I want viewers to take away. For example, I need to solidify what the wool roads and reflective obstacles represent metaphorically and test if those come across clearly. I also should explore other materials and structures beyond just a grid to see if a different configuration better suits the experience I want to create. Taking time to resolve these open questions and experiment more will help set me up for success when constructing the final installation.
