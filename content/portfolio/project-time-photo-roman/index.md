## Reflection

This is the first time for me to use Adobe Premiere Pro. At the beginning, the project production was quite challenging, but after gradually getting familiar with the workspace of Pr, the idea and creation became the focus. When I was making the photo-roman, I found that sound track played a very important role in the whole production, as it could stir up emotions and show the state of different periods. What surprised me most was that when the photo began to step on the music point, it greatly strengthened the original mood of the story version, so as to better express my ideas.
