What I heard in critique about how I can make my mask more exaggerated and interesting was:

First of all, the elements I used is a bit limited, though the idea that butterflies emerging from a cocoon is cool and suitable to my thesis of representing the transformation and self-discovery of one’s identity, to improve the strength of installing confidence, self-acceptance and the sense of identity, only emphasis the final form of the butterfly is not enough. Secondly, I should show that fear and confusion still exist, and I should show a state that goes from confusion to determination. And finally, I should explore stuff also relates to the growth of self-acceptance, such as Flower Blooming that represents growth or Moon Phases that different phases of the moon can represent the various stages of self-discovery and acceptance, with each phase signifying a different aspect of personal growth.

It was helpful because it really gives me a look on how could I improve my mask making, I've always been a little confused about the choice of elements, the discussion helped me built a new perspective on element choosing.

What I plan to do next, I will work on the head structure hidden behind on the mask and do the butterfly paper folding on it. And the fabric and silk covering on the basement. And finally the painting on the mask as well as the decorations.

For the rest of my projects, I’m planning to purchase more sparkling silver wire to construct the base of the head of the mask, and I will buy some fabric and silk to cover those wires. I will also buy some more pretty color paper to do paper cutout decorated on the head.

It took me about 1 hour to built the basic basement, I’m planning a 1 hour on improving the constructions; 30m for each paper cut out, so 10 cut outs for 5h, 2h on painting on the mask, 3h on covering the wires, 2h for purchasing. An total estimate of 11h of making process.

When I was writing the letter to my partner in seminar class, I found that my understanding of my partner was getting deeper and deeper, and her image gradually took shape in my mind. I began to figure out her predicament and thought of ways to give solutions and comfort to her from my point of view. Based on this, I then start my define of my bridge project on studio, I extract the words such as self-acceptance, determination and installing confidence from the letter I was writing. The writing process gave me a very strong basement for the define and ideation process in the design thinking for my studio class.

What I heard in the critique is:

The could be improvements on the flower hats-the color and texture should be upgraded. The current look comes off as a bit cheap. There is advice of switching it to black, which would create a nice contrast with the mask and give it a harmonious vibe.

And again, the flower elements could use some enhancements. Adding stages like flower buds at the bottom of the hat would really showcase the growth process. It's like telling a story of self-growth through the design.

the eye parts need more decoration, and those hidden cottons in the background should be removed.

And there is a suggestion of buying a model of human head to check the composition of mask and hat. It would be more easier for me to check the whole progress and perspective to better understand how the mask and hat come together.

### Next Steps

So what I plan to do next is:

Firstly, repaint the whole leaves on the flower hats, make it more linkage to the mask. There are around 40 leaves here. It will take around 5min for each one, which means a total of 3h for it. For the flower bud, it will take 15min for each one, and a total of 4h for it.

Next, I'll focus on creating a seamless connection between the mask and the hat using a Twisting stick.

I want to make more exaggeration on my mask, except for improve the mask decoration, change color of leaves and adding flower buds that shows stages. I may consider to add something that grow out of the flower hat more dramatically, and I might want to build some butterflies out of wire and let her fly out of the flower hat to show more exaggeration.
