## Introduction

This project introduced the concept of peer to peer, we first had the interview with our partners about their social identities in seminar class. Based on this, we started to create our mask using Design Thinking. This mask is designed to dissolve the issues that not only our partner is dealing with, but also for the group people with this kind of problems in the all human beings. For my project, specifically, my partner is struggling with two different identities.

## Empathize

My partner had both a rich background of Taiwanese and American culture, but she sometimes feels like she's caught between two different identities. From where I stand, I see this as something to be proud of. Even though it's not always easy, she's like a bridge between the Eastern and Western worlds. I admire her for embracing both sides of her backgroundâ€”it's not just about knowing both cultures, but also about understanding herself in a special way. It's like having a unique perspective that brings the best of both worlds together, and that's pretty awesome.

## Define

The mask is meant to help overcome feelings of confusion, exclusion, and lack of belonging due to being caught between two cultures - being seen as American in Taiwan and Taiwanese in America (and struggles similar to this). The goal is to instill confidence, self-acceptance, and a sense of identity.
