In my conversation with Bryan, I gained some valuable insights. First, he suggested I explore different artists featured in the Tate museum and iterate further on my prototype. He also encouraged me to push the interactive element even more by incorporating audio recordings that mimic the sounds disabled people hear, relating them to the obstacles I'm representing.

This feedback was really helpful, as it provides new perspective on interactivity and gives me ideas to connect my first year project to design and technology, allowing me to develop my skills.

Moving forward, I plan to first explore the textures of different materials and how they combine. I'll then create a small prototype with various materials suspended inside a cube. Additionally, I'll prototype wheel shapes using clay and wire. Finally, I'll produce audio clips related to the obstacles in my cube to enhance the interactive experience.
