## Introduction

This was a blind contour exercise, we were grouped in pairs and drew a blind contour portrait for each other. And we repeated the whole process for another group. After we were done, we did a small group critique on our works. We gave our first sensation on the works and discussed the "thinking" in the works.

## Reflection

I'm a bit drawing too fast during the exercise, therefore I didn't have a clear overview of my whole drawing and result in a massive line drawing. I should slow my pace next time and draw it in a more careful way.
